This is an important property making the communications faster between neurons.\n",

The length of Ranvier nodes is set to *1 µm*.\n",

Even if we are not modeling their frog axon, this gaves an idea of scale and justifies the negligeable error done by setting the membrane conductivity to *0.0 S/cm2*. Its Nernst potential has been set to *-65mV*, after experimental parameter fitting.  \n",

    "The results obtained and the curves fitted with linear regression are shown in the figure below. We can see that the curve for the myelinated is not perfectly linear, but behaves as linear while looked at a large scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "The left part of the graph seems strange, because the unmyelinated conduction appears to be faster than the myelinated one. The author has no concrete explanation for this phenomena. This can come from a modeling error in the parameters used for the Hodgkin-Huxley models, which would not be biologically plausible when connected with the internodes section in the myelinated axon, resulting in strange behaviour for small diameters.   \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when the axon diameter is bigger than *3 µm* the myelinated axon becomes faster, and the gap between the speeds keeps increasing with the diameter. We can there say that the myelinated axon provides an higher conduction speed, thanks to saltatory conduction.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The second figure below is showing the results obtained for the subjects diameters, *1µm*, *4µm* and *9µm*. We can see that the linear regression seems to be more accurate with these data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To further confirm the speed-against-diameter model one can build a more accurate machine learning algorithm in order to find the right model for the data. \n",
    "The simulation also need to be improved, using real world parameters to model the axons.  \n",
